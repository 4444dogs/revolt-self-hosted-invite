This is still a work-in-progress and some things may not work, notably Autumn does not auto-create S3 buckets yet and the app points to api.revolt.chat by default.

## Usage

Copy the `.env` file and edit according to your needs.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then bring up REVOLT:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
